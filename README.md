Hey all,

So I hear you all want some more programming oriented challenges instead of just doing tests so I'm going to get you guys started on a mini project in addition to what you already do for Brendon. Hopefully it is interesting and you learn alot!

So here is what I would like to be sent a link to

1) Create a github repo <br>
2) Create an html file with a form that collects firstname, lastname, and email <br>
3) Create an php file that the form submits to that will echo out firstname, lastname, email <br>

Push all this to a repo and link me once you're done.

Thanks!
